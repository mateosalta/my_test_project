Initial django ( https://www.djangoproject.com/ ) setup with vagrant ( https://www.vagrantup.com/ ) Prof of Concept for using vagrant to create a virtural machine environment.

Steps:

1. Download This code and "Vagrant" folder from GitHub
2. Install Virtural Box ( Oricle VM VirturalBox )
3. Download ( https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html ) and Install Vagrant ( https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html )
4. Open Terminal/Command line use `cd` to navigate to within the downloaded "Vagrant" folder from step 1
5. Type `vagrant up` then hit the "Enter" key
6. Vagrant should auto install the VM and configure it for this project, once you see "Server is started, Navigate to: localhost:8000 in your browser" open up a browser and open "localhost:8000"
7. Done, changes in the "Vagrant" folder should be live ( except database changes ) for those use `vagrant ssh` in the vagrant folder to access the vm's command line to perform database magamnet.
